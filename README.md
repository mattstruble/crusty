Crusty
======

Overview
========

It was a slow day at work and I was curious to see if I could make a game solely from what was installed on my computer at the time, and thus Crusty was born.

Crusty is a game engine solely focused on creating terminal games. 

This project is mostly being worked on for fun to try and see how much I can accomplish using only the default install for Python 2.7. 


Requirements
============

* Python 2.7
* Works on Linux, Windows, Mac OSX
